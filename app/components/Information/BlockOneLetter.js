      <h5>Dear GenerEOS supporters,</h5>
      <p>
        Block One recently announced that that they will be voting for Block Producers that share the core values
        necessary to maximize the integrity and potential of the EOS public blockchain network.
      </p>
      <p>
        They have provided an email for BP&apos;s and token holders to campaign for the Block Producers they
        believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would love if you could rally behind us showing your support by sending a passionate email to Block One
        explaining why they should vote for GenerEOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Send your email to - <a href="mailto:bp@eos.io?Subject=I%20Support%20GenerEOS">bp@eos.io</a>
      </p>
      <p> 
        This support would mean the world to us and help us keep creating great tools and contributions for the
        community.
      </p>
